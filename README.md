This guide was never fully completed and there are also better guides out there now, yet this guide still gets regular traffic. I recommend looking at this guide by /u/auraofire and /u/lulu1993cooly. It is MUCH faster and foolproof. [We are back with a big update to the beginner friendly AWS Foundry server deployment. Even the most basic of computer users can now deploy a Foundry server complete with SSL, web server, and reverse proxy automatically configured in a matter of minutes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/comments/j3bpdb/we_are_back_with_a_big_update_to_the_beginner/)
