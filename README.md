This guide was never fully completed and there are now better guides out there now, yet this guide still gets regular traffic. 

If you're interested in a more hands on approach, then take a look at these guides. These are were what started it all and put me down this path. [Foundry VTT Community - Self Hosting on AWS](https://foundry-vtt-community.github.io/wiki/Self-Hosting-on-AWS/)
and [Foundry VTT Community - Unbuntu VW](https://github.com/foundry-vtt-community/wiki/wiki/Ubuntu-VM)

If you're interested in a quicker and more on rails approach, then take a look at this guide by /u/auraofire and /u/lulu1993cooly. If I were to start again today, this is what I would use. [We are back with a big update to the beginner friendly AWS Foundry server deployment. Even the most basic of computer users can now deploy a Foundry server complete with SSL, web server, and reverse proxy automatically configured in a matter of minutes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundryVTT/comments/j3bpdb/we_are_back_with_a_big_update_to_the_beginner/)
